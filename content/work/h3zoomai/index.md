This was my second internship. I decided to spend the summer of 2018 interning at an award-winning startup based in Singapore.

H3Zoom (previously "H3 Dynamics") is an AI-based startup specializing in building automated facade inspection using drones. I worked directly under the CTO to learn about the systems help in classifying test data.

Some of tasks involved manually classifying data for training. While this is tedious, it is necessary. Towards the end, I was able to write a script that would take an image of a building and highlight all the cracks on the facade. Creating this script was certainly interesting: while I had little guidance, I did have the freedom to learn about new technologies.
