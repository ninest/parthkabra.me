During my first internship as a web developer, I gained valuable experience working in a professional environment. I took this opportunity to learn the basics of web development including technologies such as HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Django.

I also learned about collaboration tools such as Git, which allowed me to work efficiently with my team. Furthermore, I had the opportunity to look further into data structures and algorithms. Overall, my first internship gave me a solid introduction to the field of computer science and software engineering, and showed me that this is what I want to do.
