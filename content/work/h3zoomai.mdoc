For my second internship, I had the opportunity to work at H3Zoom, an award-winning AI-based startup in Singapore that specializes in building facade inspection using drones. This internship provided me with my first exposure to machine learning.

Working directly under the CTO, I was tasked with classifying test data and manually labeling data for training. As I gained more experience, I was able to take on more challenging projects, such as writing a script that could identify and highlight cracks on a building. I enjoyed the freedom of exploring new technologies and using various APIs.

In short, this experience sparked my interest in machine learning and artificial intelligence.
