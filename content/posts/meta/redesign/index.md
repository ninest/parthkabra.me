Before this redesign, my website looked like this (the 2020 version):

<Image {...images.main20} border />

And now, in 2021, it looks like this:

<Image {...images.main21} border />

When I first made my website in 2020, all I wanted to do was show off my projects. I wanted to have something that looked like a resume or like my GitHub profile, but with more information. Each project had its own page, and there was no blog.

In 2021, I wanted to make the website more minimal, add some nice icons, and add a blog. I also switched from Vue and Nuxt to React and Next to learn a new tech stack. So far, it's been going great and I love `getStaticPaths` and `getStaticProps` for generating static websites. I also switched from plain CSS to Tailwind CSS, and it definitely makes me more productive.
