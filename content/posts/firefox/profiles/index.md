Firefox Profiles allow you to have multiple instances of Firefox on a single computer. Each instance can have their own extensions, settings, themes, cookies, browsing history, etc.

By default, there's only one profile on Firefox. To create a new one, open Firefox and type `about:profiles` in the search bar and press enter.

Click on "Create a New Profile" and follow the steps. Once it's created, you can launch it by clicking "Launch Profile in new browser".

If you use multiple accounts for a website, it is simpler to use [Firefox's Mutli-Account Containers](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/multi-account-containers/).
