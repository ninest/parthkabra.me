> I stayed in a Hotel for a semester in university, but I did not enjoy it.

I don't think that's something you hear very often. Don't get me wrong; the hotel room was amazing and I loved living near Downtown. It was my roommate that was the problem. I never knew how much a bad roommate can affect your life. Despite living in a 5-star hotel, my life was a living nightmare.

Also, I'm an introvert, and wherever possible, I'll try to resolve a problem without talking.

## A bit about myself

I'm no stranger to roommate living. In fact, I've lived in rooms with 10-16 other people in my [National Service](/work/saf) in the Singapore Army.

I'm not a clean freak by any means, and I have always been able to fall off asleep in noise. In fact, if there's one thing I learned in the army, it's that I can fall off asleep anywhere, in any condition! Though this semester, I learned that that's not entirely true.

## Day 0

My roommate moved in pretty early, so he had already set up his stuff by the time I moved in. He wasn't really doing anything when I first entered, so I thought I'd make some conversation and see if he wants to grab lunch or dinner together. Maybe we can be good friends and walk to campus together every morning!

This is how our first conversation went:

> Hi, I'm Parth! \
> _Hi._ \
> I'm from Singapore, and I'm a computer science major. \
> What's your major? \
> _I'm from China._

.. after that, he proceeded to put on headphones and start gaming. I guess he misheard. I thought, maybe I'll ask him later. Last I checked, "From China" isn't a major our school offers.

But I couldn't. I don't think he took off his headphones for the rest of the day.

While I was unpacking my stuff, I quickly found out that this guy wasn't clean.

I love Chex Mix, and I was surprised to find it in my room! Only problem, it was on the floor near my bed along with other crumbs. Obviously I didn't eat it, I'm pretty sure it was wet.

## Day 1

This guy never left the room. From morning to night, he'd pretty much just sit in the same spot gaming. Some evenings, I'd leave for dinner hoping he wouldn't be there just so I could get some privacy and alone time, but he was always right there sitting in the same spot.

Classes hadn't started yet. So I guess he'd leave the room when then?

## Day 2

I usually spend a few minutes cleaning the bathroom every 2-3 days. I am in no way a clean freak or anything, but I do prefer the surfaces, especially in the bathroom, to be dry if possible.

{% div className="flex items-center space-x-lg" %}

{% pee-seat / %}
{% /div %}

{% div %}
But the seat was pretty wet and yellow. This wasn't your typical _accidental poor aim_ of pee. It really looked like someone completely unloaded their bladder and discolored the white seat.
{% /div %}
{% /div %}

If there's one color I hate seeing in the bathroom, it has to be yellow. And brown too I guess.

Also, why's it this yellow? I thought a cold country meant you'd guess less dehydrated.

Anyways, I cleaned the seat, but I decided to wait until my roommate wakes up to discuss a cleaning schedule. I thought we could do something similar. Both of us take 2 days a week where we spend 15 minutes cleaning the bathroom. Nothing too complicated, just clean and wipe all surfaces, and of course, clean up after yourself.

At 9 AM, he was still fast asleep. Understandable, classes hadn't started yet.

10 AM, still snoring. Perhaps he was up late last night (he was).

ðŸ•š 11 AM. Is he dead? Is he even in eastern standard time?

I had to leave the room to grab lunch. I knew I wasn't going to be back until late, so I messaged him instead.

{% chat messages=[
  {me: true, text: "Hi, may I know on what days you clean the bathroom?",},
  {me: true, text: "Do let me know so we can set up a schedule for both of us to clean",},
  {me: false, text: "The school will clean it regularly."},
  {me: false, text: "Someone will clean the toilet for us. You can use the vacuum if you feel dirty."}
]/ %}

To be fair, he wasn't wrong. We were living in a hotel that semester, and a housekeeper was sent regularly to clean the bathroom and ensure we aren't keeping it too dirty. But they were sent only once or twice a month, and I don't want to wait that long for his pee to be cleaned off of the seat. Vacuuming the bathroom isn't enough to keep it clean.

I tried to explain that that isn't enough. Again, I'm not a clean freak and all I was asking for him to spend a few minutes cleaning the bathroom every week and not make a mess.

{% chat messages={[
  {me: true, text: "True, but that's only twice a month", replyTo: "The school will clean it regularly."},
  {me: true, text: "We should make schedule. One of us can clean the bathroom every 3 days, how does that sound?"},
  {me: false, text: "No I'm good. The only cleaning we need to do is taking out the trash."}
]} %}

That night, when I reached home, he was luckily not wearing headphones so I spoke about our conversation. I also took him to the bathroom and pointed out his fresh yellow pee on the toilet, the wet floors, and the counter and said, this is what need to be cleaned.

He seemed to agree, so I thought this was the last time I see that fresh yellow stuff.

Spoiler: I was wrong. We seemed to have a mutual understanding on bathroom cleanliness but more of that yellow stuff kept coming.

We also discussed our roommate agreement. It was pretty simple and we wrote about the bathroom cleaning schedule, how we'd like to be informed if the other is bringing guests, and keep the room quiet after 9 PM.

But as we'll see soon, to him, it was more of a roommate "suggestion".

## Day 4

I woke up at 11 PM to the sounds of a helicopter. Yeah I guess living in Downtown is cool and all, but ...

Wait, it's actually my roommate's gaming laptop

It's cooling fans make a helicopter-like sound for 30 seconds and then are quiet for 10 seconds. This cycle keeps repeating.

It doesn't help that he has a clicky mechanical keyboard and an equally clicky mouse. Anyone who knows what these monstrosities sounds like will understand my plight.

I am used to sleeping in noise, but it's very annoying when the noise is a mechanical keyboard at 2 AM in the morning.

## Day 7

I was certain he isn't cleaning the bathrooms. This morning I woke up to a pee doused toilet seat with a side of un-flushed poop. My favorite way to start the semester!

He wasn't awake yet and I had to leave for classes, so I messaged him as I left for school.

{% chat messages=[
  {me: true, text: "Have you cleaned the bathroom in the past week?"}
] / %}

He didn't reply. I am an introvert so I was a little hesitant to keep bringing this up.

I was a little uncomfortable with bringing this up, so I just let it go. After all, cleaning the toilets doesn't take all that long.

## Day 9

I really want to wake up early tomorrow to go for a run. But it's 1 AM and I'm still wide awake.

I shouldn't be the only one to experience this helicopter + mechanical electrical keyboard orchestra, so you can try it for yourself too.

## Day 13

At 11 AM, before going to sleep, I talked to my roommate and asked him two things. "Can you please keep it down? I have a test tomorrow?" He said okay. I also asked, "Can you please turn off your lamp? It's really difficult to sleep".

And he did.

Wow, that was easy

I got a few minutes of peace of quiet, because he started using his laptop's quieter keyboard instead of his mechanical keyboard.

Less than 10 minutes later, he starts using his mechanical keyboard again and is talking to friends while gaming. He's clicking and typing it so aggressively, making it impossible to fall off asleep.

From my bed, I asked him again, "Can you please keep it down"? He didn't hear me. I walked and stood right next to him, and he still didn't hear me, or he was just being disrespectful. I tapped his shoulder, waited for him to take out his headphones and asked again. I also told him, "Please understand how loud you're being. I really have to wake up early tomorrow for a test". While I was talking to him, he wasn't even looking at me. He didn't even take his eyes off his screen and was still gaming while I was talking to him. He said okay, then disconnected his mechanical keyboard and put it on the floor, and also stopped talking to his friends.

That was it. I couldn't take this lying down for the rest of the semester.

The next day, I immediately wrote to my floor's RA to see what can be done about breaking the roommate agreement. I asked if we can meet and discuss what I can do about this and how I can talk to my roommate.

## Day 15

For the first time this semester, I came back to the room and he wasn't there. One of my classes got cancelled, and I had nothing to do on campus so I just came back.

The room felt so different and so amazing without him. I was just watching a show and enjoying my alone time. Unfortunately, this was one of the last times in the semester I got this privacy.

The room is pretty big, with a queen and king-sized bed, a TV, and a bathroom. I had the king-sized bed, and he had the queen-sized bed. I'd have preferred the queen-sized bed because it's on the side of the room with the window so it has more space. But he got here first and got his first choice/

In around half an hour, the door opened and he came in. As usual, he did not close it gently. He let it slam. I'm not joking when I say this, but I can actually feel the entire room vibrate when lets it slam like this. The RAs have sent emails about this and asked that we close doors gently. But rules don't apply to him.

My RA replied to the email I sent. We've set up a meeting to discuss the roommate agreement.

## Day 18

It's so hot. It's winter, and less than 0ÂºC outside, but my room is so hot that I'm actually sweating. The thermostat is around 27ÂºC! I'm not sure why it's even set that high. I just set it down to 24ÂºC. I like the room cooler, but I guess my roommate likes it warmer.

## Day 20

The room feels as hot as Singapore again. This time, he's not wearing his headphones, so I asked him, "Is 24ÂºC a fine temperature for you?" He replied, "Sure" without looking at me.

But two minutes after I set it to 24ÂºC, he set it back to the highest temperature possible. I asked him about it.

> Why did you put the temperature back up? Didn't you say you were okay with 24? \
> _I feel cold._ \
> Can we try to come to a compromise on the temperature? Can we keep it a little but cooler? \
> _No_. \
> _I feel cold. You can open the window._

And so I did. I have opened it previously a
