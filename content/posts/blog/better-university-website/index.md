## The problem

My university (Northeastern University) used to have this website called myNortheastern. It was pretty simple and easy to use, and contained a list of useful links and resources, such as Canvas, advising services, course registration, degree audit, printing services, and more. It was a list of links to other pages.

Unfortunately, it was closed in favor of the new and "improved" Student Hub which is not as user-friendly. The page takes around 10 seconds to load completely. Accessing simple links takes a lot of clicks. It is not very mobile friendly.

## A simple website

After being accepted, I was always getting overwhelmed by the number of links and resources and how they're all over the place. So I created a Google Sheet for myself. I that that other incoming freshmen could benefit from this too, so I decided to share it around. I had added many categories such as Services, Personal resources, free stuff, and so on.

I like to create websites, so using Google Sheets as a backend, I made a simple website:

<Image {...images.neulinks} narrower border />

And of course, it's mobile friendly too!

<div className="flex space-x-xl md:w-4/6 m-auto">
  <Image {...images.neulinksMobile} border />
  <Image {...images.neulinksMobileFree} border />
</div>

It's not the best website, but it works, and people seem to like it! I'm gonna continue working on this and make small improvements here and there.
