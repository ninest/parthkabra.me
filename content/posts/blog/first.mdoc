## Hello!

Regular alert with a title:

{% alert
   variant="default"
   title="This is a primary alert with a title and a body" %}
This is the body of the alert.
{% /alert %}

Alert without a title:

{% alert variant="secondary" %}
This is a secondary alert without a title but with a body, obviously.
{% /alert %}

{% alert variant="default" %}
This is a default one.
{% /alert %}

Chat interface:

{% chat
   messages=[{me: true, text: "Hello!"}, {me: false, text: "Yo!"}, {me: true, text: "What're you up to today", replyTo: "Yo!"}, {me: false, text: "Nothing much, you?", replyTo: "What're you up to today"}, {me: true, text: "Amazing", replyTo: "Nothing much, you?"}] /%}

Some more special components: the keyboard:

{% keyboard /%}

This is a longer alert:

{% alert variant="default" %}
This is a pretty long alert

## It has a title!

- And a list of points because why not
- Let's make another one
- We love nested points

```javascript
const a = 1
// javascript rocks
```

## Section two

This just goes on.

Do not nest alerts.

Yeah. It's long.
{% /alert %}

This is some more code:

```markdown
## Hello

- this is a code block
- it is cool
- this is a long code this is a long code this is a long code this is a long code this is a long code
```
