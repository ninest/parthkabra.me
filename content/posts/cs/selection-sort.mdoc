## Steps

- Loop through the array
- Find the smallest element in the unsorted portion of the array
- Swap the smallest element with the first element in the unsorted portion of the array

*The sorted portion of the array is on the left side while the unsorted portion is on the right. In the diagrams below, the blue boxes represent the*  ***sorted***  *elements of the array, while the white boxes represent the*  ***unsorted***  *elements. Elements that are going to be swapped are shown in green boxes.*

On every iteration, an element from the unsorted portion is added to the sorted portion. For example, if we start with this array:

{% mermaid %}
graph LR

3 --- 5 --- 2 --- 1 --- 9 --- 6
{% /mermaid %}
