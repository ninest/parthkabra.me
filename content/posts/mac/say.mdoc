To have your computer speak to you open your terminal and enter:

```
say "Your Text Here"
```

## Customizing the voice

Pass in `--voice` (or `-v`). For example:

```
say "Jelly" -v "Albert"
```

To list out all voices, use

```
say -v '?'
```

{% alert
   variant="secondary"
   title="Finding voices from system preferences" %}
There is another way to find voices.

Go to the **System Preferences** app. Open **Accessibility** > **Spoken Content**. You will see the **System Voice** dropdown.

Open that dropdown and note down the voice names you see (but don't change them!). Here are a list of voices I see:

- Daniel
- Kate
- Deranged
- ...

For example,

```
say "This is the deranged voice" -v "Deranged"
```
{% /alert %}

{% alert variant="secondary" title="Testing out different voices" %}
Go to the **System Preferences** app. Open **Accessibility** > **Spoken Content**. You will see the **System Voice** dropdown.

Scroll to the bottom and click the "Customize" button:

![](/images/mac/say/customize.png)

You can now browse through all voices, and click "Play" to test them out:

{% /alert %}

## Reading from a file

Use the `--input-file` (`-f`) to specify the file to read from.

Say you have this file, `say.txt`:

```
We're no strangers to love
You know the rules and so do I
A full commitment's what I'm thinking of
You wouldn't get this from any other guy
```

Have your computer sing with

```
say -f song.text
```

You an also use the pipe operator: `cat song.text | say`.

## Rate

Use `--rate` (`-r`) to control the rate in **words per minute** of the sound.

For example,

```
say "I am in a rush!" -r 500
```

{% alert variant="secondary" title="What's the default rate?" %}
See this question on AskDifferent: [What is the default speaking rate for the speech synthesis program?](https://apple.stackexchange.com/q/96808/419233)
{% /alert %}

## Saving as mp4 or aiff

Pass in the `--output-file` (`-o`) to pass an output file. For example:

```
say "Happy birthday!" -o birthday.mp3
```

Note that some audios may not support one of the formats.

{% alert variant="secondary" %}
If you try to save the output as an `mp3` file (example: `say "hello" -o voice.mp3`), you may see this error:

```
Specifying ExtAudioFileRef failed: -50
```

To save as `mp3`, first save as `aiff`, then use the lame encoder to convert it to `mp3`:

```
say "Never gonna give you up" -o voice.aiff
lame -m m voice.aiff voice.mp3
```

Install lame with `brew install lame`.
