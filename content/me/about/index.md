## Hello!

This page is still a work in progress ...

{% /alert %}

I'm a computer science student at **Northeastern University**, in Boston, MA. I'm in my second year, and I'm looking for internships and co-ops in in the fields of software engineering and data science.

I have [previously interned](/work) under the roles of a data scientist, and software engineer. In my free time, I enjoy working on [my own projects](/projects). I hope to share guides on simple but interesting topics on [my blog](/blog).
