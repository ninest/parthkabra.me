Hyperlocal is a platform to create and share maps. Basically, it aims to be Google Docs but for maps with features like map publishing and realtime collaboration.

Map-making, for day trip planning, data visualization, etc, has never been the easiest for a non-technical person, and I would like to try and address that.
