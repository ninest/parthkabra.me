Northeastern University has great websites, but at times I felt that they lacking in terms speed and the level of useful information provided. For instance, I often found myself relying on Reddit for useful information.

Husker has over 750 daily active users.

Another issue was that it was often difficult to access important links, such as the course registration portal or housing information, at a glance.

I decided to make a website similar to the [National Service Resources website](/project/nsr), which aims to be a consolidated portal of links, resources, and for students of Northeastern University.

### Links page

The main page contains links to various resources. All these links are available through university resources, but they're all over the place and it can be difficult to find.

### Wiki

The wiki is a central hub where students can create and share guides with others. It is a collaborative platform where students can continuously keep knowledge up to date. The most populate wiki page. The most popular wiki page is currently the [Free Stuff page.](https://www.husker.nu/wiki/free)

## Current status

I am receiving feedback and suggestions from students to improve the website. Since I am graduating soon, I am looking to transfer the project to others to maintain.
