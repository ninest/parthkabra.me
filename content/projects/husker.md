Northeastern University has great websites, but at times I felt that they lacking in terms speed and the level of useful information provided. For instance, I often found myself relying on Reddit for useful information.

Read my [blog post](/blog/better-university-website) about this project!

Another issue was that it was often difficult to access important links, such as the course registration portal or housing information, at a glance.

I decided to make a website similar to the [National Service Resources website](/project/nsr), which aims to be a consolidated portal of links, resources, and for students of Northeastern University.

## Current status

I am receiving feedback and suggestions from students to improve the website.
