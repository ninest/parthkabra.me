Northeastern University has great websites, but at times I felt that they lacking in terms speed and the level of useful information provided. For instance, I often found myself relying on Reddit for useful information.

<div className="flex space-x-base">
  <Image {...images.mobileDark} />
  <Image {...images.mobileLight} border />
</div>

Another issue was that it was often difficult to access important links, such as the course registration portal or housing information, at a glance.

I decided to make a website similar to the [National Service Resources website](/project/nsr), which aims to be a consolidated portal of links, resources, and for students of Northeastern University.

## Current status

I am receiving feedback and suggestions from students to improve the website.
