This was my first successful web and mobile app, that enabled me to learn all of what it takes to publish on the Play Store and App Store.

## Why I created it

**Brooklyn Nine-Nine** has always been my favorite show, and I was interested in an app one of the characters created. In Season 5, Gina Linetti created a soundboard app for Captain Raymond Holt.

I tried the existing "Holt Soundboard" apps, but all of them fell short of my expectations. I decided to learn web and app development to try and make my own. It indeed turned out quite well, garnering over 12,000 installs in the Play Store.

## Technologies

The web app was first written in plain HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, but as I grew as a developer, I realized that I could release new features faster and easier by transitioning to a frontend framework. I decided on **Vue** as my first framework for its ease of use, but I for this particular project, I used **Nuxt**, a framework on Vue, which provides more features out of the box including search-engine optimization.

I chose **Flutter** for the mobile app for its ease of use, great developer experience, and platform-agnostic development. I was able to release the app for iOS and Android with minimal effort.

## Current status

I realized later that the soundbites are copyrighted from the production studio of the show, NBC. After carrying out further research, I found out that using the sounds in my app does not come under fair use. I decided to un-publish the app until I am able to secure permissions.
