I'm a computer science student at Northeastern University, in Boston, MA. I'm graduating in May 2025, and I'm looking for jobs in the fields of software engineering and data science.

I have [previously interned](/work) under the roles of a data scientist, and software engineer. In my free time, I enjoy working on [my own projects](/projects). I also share guides on simple but interesting topics on [my blog](/blog).

## Now

I recently finished by internship with Alignable as a software engineer. I am looking for full-time roles as I am graduating in May 2025.

At Northeastern, I'm a software developer at the club [Northeastern Electric Racing](/work/northeastern-electric-racing) where I am developing a full-stack project management dashboard used by over 200 members to manage more than 80 projects.
